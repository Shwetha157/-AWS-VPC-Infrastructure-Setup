📐 Architecture Overview
VPC with Public & Private Subnets
Designed and deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

Internet Gateway (IGW) & NAT Gateway
Configured IGW for internet access to public subnets and NAT Gateway for secure internet access from private subnets.

Route Tables
Custom route tables created and associated with respective subnets to ensure proper routing.

VPC Peering
Enabled secure communication between VPCs for cross-VPC traffic.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) & Security Groups
Applied for layered security and traffic control at subnet and instance levels.

EC2 Instances
Deployed in both public and private subnets for different use cases (e.g., web servers, application servers).
